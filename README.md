   - See [Janice API Documentation](https://janice.e-351.com/api/rest/docs/index.html) for more information
3. **ESI Token** (Optional but recommended): For advanced features, FCs need ESI tokens with these scopes:
   - `esi-fleets.read_fleet.v1` - Import fleet composition

## Installation

### Step 1: Install the Package

Install the package into your Alliance Auth virtual environment:

INSTALLED_APPS += [
    'aapayout',
]
```

### Step 3: Configure Settings

Add your Janice API key to your `local.py` settings file:

```python
# Janice API Configuration (REQUIRED)
AAPAYOUT_JANICE_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"  # Get this from https://janice.e-351.com
AAPAYOUT_JANICE_MARKET = "jita"          # Market hub: jita, amarr, dodixie, rens, hek
AAPAYOUT_JANICE_PRICE_TYPE = "buy"      # Price type: buy or sell

# Payout Configuration
AAPAYOUT_CORP_SHARE_PERCENTAGE = 10     # Percentage of loot value to corporation
AAPAYOUT_MINIMUM_PAYOUT = 1000000       # Minimum payout amount in ISK (1M ISK)
AAPAYOUT_SCOUT_BONUS_PERCENTAGE = 10    # Scout bonus percentage (default: +10%)

# Optional: Holding Corporation
AAPAYOUT_HOLDING_CORP_ID = 123456       # EVE corporation ID for corp share recipient
```

### Step 4: Run Migrations

Run Django migrations to create the database tables:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 5: Collect Static Files

Collect static files:

```bash

4. Click **Import**
5. System will automatically add all fleet members and deduplicate alts

### Adding Loot

1. Open your fleet
2. Click **Add Loot Pool**
3. Give the loot pool a name (e.g., "Main Haul")
4. Paste raw loot text from EVE client:
   - Select items in cargo/contract
   - Copy (Ctrl+C in EVE)
   - Paste into the "Raw Loot Text" field
5. Click **Create**
6. System will automatically value loot via Janice API
7. Corporation share is automatically set to 10% if per-character payout > 200k ISK, otherwise 0%

### Reviewing and Approving Payouts

1. View the loot pool details to see valued items
2. Click **Edit Item** to manually adjust any prices if needed
3. Click **Approve Payouts**
4. Review the payout preview:
   - Base share per participant
   - Scout bonuses (if any scouts marked)
   - Corporation share (auto-calculated: 10% if per-character > 200k ISK, else 0%)
   - Total distribution
5. Click **Approve**

### Processing Payments

**Option 1: Regular Mode**
1. Go to **Payout List** for the loot pool
2. For each payout:
   - Open EVE client
   - Send ISK to recipient character
   - Click **Mark as Paid**
   - Enter transaction reference (optional)
   - Confirm

**Option 2: Express Mode** (Recommended)
1. Go to **Payout List** for the loot pool
2. Click **Express Mode**
3. For each payout:
   - Press `O` to open character window in EVE (via ESI)
   - Transfer ISK manually in EVE client
   - Press `Space` to mark as paid and move to next
4. System tracks progress and estimates time remaining

**Option 3: Payment Verification**
1. Make all payments manually in EVE client
2. Go to **Payout List**
3. Click **Verify Payments**
4. System checks your wallet journal via ESI
5. Automatically marks matching payments as verified

### Viewing Payout History

1. Click **Payout History** in the main menu
2. Use filters to find specific payouts:
   - Filter by fleet
   - Filter by status (pending/paid)
   - Filter by date range
   - Search by character or fleet name
3. View summary statistics (total paid, pending, etc.)

## How It Works

### Payout Calculation

1. **Corporation Share**: Automatically set to 10% if per-character payout > 200k ISK, otherwise 0%
2. **Character Deduplication**: Group alts by main character (one payout per human)
3. **Base Share**: Remaining ISK split evenly among unique players
4. **Scout Bonus**: Scouts get +10% additional ISK (not a multiplier)
5. **Rounding**: Individual shares round down to nearest 0.01 ISK
6. **Remainder**: Rounding remainder goes to corporation

**Example** (100M ISK loot, 3 players, 2 scouts):
- Corp share: 10M ISK
- Participant pool: 90M ISK
- Base share: 90M / 3 = 30M ISK
- Scout bonus: 30M * 0.10 = 3M ISK
- Scout A: 30M + 3M = 33M ISK
- Scout B: 30M + 3M = 33M ISK
- Regular: 30M ISK
- Total paid: 96M ISK
- Corp final: 10M + 4M remainder = 14M ISK

## Configuration

Additional configuration options in your `local.py`:

```python
# Advanced Configuration
AAPAYOUT_JANICE_TIMEOUT = 30             # API request timeout in seconds
AAPAYOUT_JANICE_CACHE_HOURS = 1         # Cache appraisals for this many hours
AAPAYOUT_REQUIRE_APPROVAL = True        # Require FC approval before payouts

# ESI Integration
AAPAYOUT_ESI_FLEET_IMPORT_ENABLED = True  # Enable ESI fleet import
AAPAYOUT_EXPRESS_MODE_ENABLED = True      # Enable Express Mode payment interface

# Payment Verification
AAPAYOUT_VERIFICATION_TIME_WINDOW_HOURS = 24  # Wallet journal search window
AAPAYOUT_AUTO_VERIFY_AFTER_PAYMENT = True     # Auto-verify after Express Mode
```

## Troubleshooting

### Janice API Issues

**Problem**: "Failed to value loot" error
- **Solution**: Check your Janice API key is valid and has not expired
- **Solution**: Verify your Janice account has sufficient API credits
- **Solution**: Check network connectivity to janice.e-351.com

### ESI Import Issues

**Problem**: "ESI fleet import failed" error
- **Solution**: Ensure you have added an ESI token with `esi-fleets.read_fleet.v1` scope
- **Solution**: Verify your ESI fleet ID is correct (visible in EVE fleet window)
- **Solution**: Ensure you are the fleet commander or have fleet boss role

### Express Mode Issues

**Problem**: Character window not opening in EVE
- **Solution**: Ensure EVE client is running and logged in
- **Solution**: Verify you have ESI token with `esi-ui.open_window.v1` scope
- **Solution**: Check you are logged into the correct character

### Payment Verification Issues

**Problem**: Payments not being verified
- **Solution**: Ensure you have ESI token with `esi-wallet.read_character_journal.v1` scope
- **Solution**: Verify you made the payment from the correct character
- **Solution**: Check the payment was made within the time window (default 24 hours)
- **Solution**: Ensure payment amount matches exactly (within 0.01 ISK)
